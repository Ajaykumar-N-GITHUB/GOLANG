Certainly! To manage branches and commit files in Git, you can follow these steps:

1. Create a New Branch
Check your current branch:

sh
Copy code
git branch
This will list all the branches and highlight the current branch you're on.

Create a new branch:

sh
Copy code
git checkout -b new-branch-name
Replace new-branch-name with the name you want for your new branch. This command creates the branch and switches to it.

2. Make Changes and Commit Files
Make changes to your files as needed.

Stage the changes:

sh
Copy code
git add .
This stages all changed files for commit. You can also specify individual files if you don't want to stage everything.

Commit the changes:

sh
Copy code
git commit -m "Your commit message here"
Replace "Your commit message here" with a descriptive message about the changes you made.

3. Switch Back to the Original Branch
Switch to the branch you want to merge into (usually main or master):
sh
Copy code
git checkout main
Replace main with the name of your main branch if it’s different.
4. Merge the New Branch into the Original Branch
Merge the branch:

sh
Copy code
git merge new-branch-name
Replace new-branch-name with the name of the branch you created and committed changes in.

Resolve any conflicts if necessary. Git will let you know if there are conflicts that need to be resolved manually. After resolving conflicts, you need to add the resolved files and commit the merge:

sh
Copy code
git add resolved-file
git commit
5. Push Changes to Remote Repository
Push the updated branch (if you’re working with a remote repository):
sh
Copy code
git push origin main
Again, replace main with your branch name if it’s different.
Summary of Commands
Create a new branch:

sh
Copy code
git checkout -b new-branch-name
Stage changes:

sh
Copy code
git add .
Commit changes:

sh
Copy code
git commit -m "Your commit message here"
Switch to the main branch:

sh
Copy code
git checkout main
Merge the new branch:

sh
Copy code
git merge new-branch-name
Push changes to the remote repository:

sh
Copy code
git push origin main
This should cover the basic workflow for creating a branch, committing changes, and merging branches in Git. If you have more complex scenarios or need additional help, feel free to ask!

You said:
so if want to raise the pr then i should not run that merge command right?

Correct! If you want to raise a Pull Request (PR), you should not run the merge command locally. Here’s the revised workflow:

Workflow for Raising a Pull Request
Create and Switch to a New Branch:

sh
Copy code
git checkout -b new-branch-name
Make your changes in this branch.

Stage and Commit Your Changes:

sh
Copy code
git add .
git commit -m "Your commit message here"
Push Your Branch to the Remote Repository:

sh
Copy code
git push origin new-branch-name
Raise a Pull Request:

Go to Your Repository on GitHub/GitLab/Bitbucket (or whichever Git hosting service you use).
Navigate to the Pull Requests (PR) section.
Click "New Pull Request".
Select Your Branch as the source branch and the branch you want to merge into (e.g., main or master) as the target branch.
Add a Title and Description for your pull request.
Create the Pull Request.
Review and Merge the Pull Request:

Once the PR is created, it can be reviewed by team members or automated checks.
After approval, the PR can be merged via the Git hosting service’s interface.
Summary of Commands for PR Workflow
Create and switch to a new branch:

sh
Copy code
git checkout -b new-branch-name
Stage and commit changes:

sh
Copy code
git add .
git commit -m "Your commit message here"
Push your branch to the remote repository:

sh
Copy code
git push origin new-branch-name
Create a Pull Request on your Git hosting service.

Notes
Local Merges: Merging branches locally is done when you want to integrate changes directly in your local environment or before pushing changes to a remote branch, but it's not necessary for creating a PR.
PR Reviews: Pull Requests provide a structured way for code reviews and discussions before changes are integrated into the main branch.
